# UFO Sightings

## Overview of the Project:

### Purpose
Danaâ€™s wants to more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time on the web page. In addition to the date, the following additional filters have been added to the web page:
  - City
  - State
  - Country
  - Shape.

## Results:

### City
A visitor can use the web page to filter according to the city city in which the sighting has occured. In our example below, all sightings for St. Louis have been listed, which happens to be just a single sighting.

### State
A visitor can use the web page to filter according to the state state in which the sighting has occured. In our example below, all sightings for California have been listed, which happens to be a long list.

## Summary:

### Drawback: 
The search field must be populated with text in the same upper/lower case as the existing entries in the database or we do not get an appropriate result.

### Additional Recommendations
1. The page should have an additional filter added for Time of the sighting. This will help analyze the time of day most sightings occur.
2. There should be an export feature which allows the search results to be exported as a CSV or XML file for additional analysis.
